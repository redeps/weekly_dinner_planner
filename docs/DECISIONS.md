# Architecture Decisions — Meal Planner

Append-only log. Add new entries at the bottom with a date. Do not rewrite
history here — if a decision is reversed, add a new entry that supersedes it
and note what it replaces.

## 2026-08-31 — Local-first prototype

Use Streamlit + SQLite initially, same as the home inventory project. No
hosted database, no hosted file storage, no authentication layer. The
application must run entirely inside a GitHub Codespace with no external
services required.

## 2026-08-31 — Seasonality is weighted, not filtered

Recipes tagged for the current season are preferred by the plan generator,
but off-season recipes remain selectable (not hard-excluded). All-season
recipes are treated as a safe default with neutral weight.

## 2026-08-31 — Rotation avoidance via cook history

The plan generator deprioritizes recipes cooked within a recent window,
derived from `cook_history.cooked_on` (see `DATA_MODEL.md`). The exact
window length (e.g. 3 weeks) is not yet fixed — to be decided and recorded
here when Milestone 4 is implemented.

## 2026-08-31 — Prepopulated quick-fallback recipes

The app seeds a small set of recipes flagged `is_quick_fallback = true`
(e.g. fish fingers, frozen pizza, takeout) with minimal or no ingredients
and very low cook time, for the generator to lean on for busy days. These
are ordinary, editable recipes — the flag is only a generator signal.

## 2026-08-31 — Grocery list is not a shopping-mode feature

The grocery list is a simple generated, read-only, grouped-by-category view.
It is transcribed by hand rather than used directly in-store, so no
check-off state, persistence-while-shopping, or mobile "shopping mode" is
built.

## 2026-08-31 — AI assist via local model (Ollama), optional

The app integrates a locally-run model (e.g. via Ollama) for a bounded set
of assistive features: recipe import from pasted text/URL, ingredient
store-category suggestions, swap suggestions with a free-text intent hint,
and effort-saving shortcut suggestions. This keeps the app free-first (no
paid API) and consistent with local-first architecture. The integration is
optional and isolated in its own service module — no core screen depends on
it being available, and imported/suggested content is always
reviewed/confirmed by the user before being saved, never written
automatically. Scheduled for Milestone 8, after the core plan/grocery flow
is working.

## 2026-08-31 — Cook Mode reuses existing instructions text

Rather than introducing a structured "steps" table, Cook Mode (large-font,
step-by-step view for use while actively cooking) derives its steps by
splitting the existing `recipes.instructions` text at render time. Keeps
the schema unchanged; can be revisited later if a real need for
individually-orderable, richer steps emerges.

## 2026-08-31 — Structured-data recipe import; swappable AI backend (supersedes the AI-assist entry above)

Two problems were bundled into "AI Assist" that shouldn't have been: import
friction and language-model-dependent suggestions. Splitting them:

**Recipe import** now has a primary path that needs no model at all:
parsing `schema.org/Recipe` JSON-LD structured data from a given URL. This
is deterministic, free, and works identically whether the app is running
locally or hosted. The AI-assist text parser from Milestone 9 becomes a
fallback, used only for pasted free text or pages without structured data.

**AI Assist's suggestion features** (categorization, swap-intent, shortcut
suggestions) still genuinely need a language model and remain optional —
but the backend is now swappable rather than Ollama-only: local Ollama for
development (no cost, no key), or Google Gemini's free tier (chosen for
model quality over Groq/others) when no local model server is reachable,
e.g. the eventual Milestone 13 hosted deployment. This knowingly relaxes
"no cloud services" for this one narrow, optional feature — deliberately,
not by accident. Gemini's free tier is a standing tier (not trial credits)
and its rate limits comfortably cover a household's occasional use. The API
key is stored as a secret and never committed.

This was flagged late — after Milestone 9 shipped, not while it was being
scoped — because the hosted-deployment implication of an Ollama-only design
wasn't surfaced at design time. Recorded here so the gap and the fix are
both visible going forward. See Milestone 10 in `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

## 2026-08-31 — Structured-data parser is stdlib-only, no scraping library

The URL import path (above) is implemented as our own small parser using
only `urllib`, `html.parser`, and `json` — deliberately not a third-party
scraping package such as `recipe-scrapers`. We only need the generic,
standardized `schema.org/Recipe` JSON-LD block, not the hundreds of
site-specific scrapers such a package bundles; those per-site scrapers are
themselves a maintenance liability (they break whenever a site redesigns,
and the package has to be kept updated to match). A minimal in-house parser
targeting a stable published standard is smaller, has nothing to break in
the same way, and better matches this project's "small, easy to maintain"
principle than adding a large third-party dependency for a narrow need.

## 2026-08-31 — Photo-based recipe import always uses Gemini

Photo import (for recipes only available on paper — existing cookbooks,
recipe cards) has no non-AI fallback, unlike URL import. It requires a
vision-capable model. Rather than supporting a local vision model via
Ollama, photo import always calls the hosted Gemini backend, regardless of
which backend is configured for the text-only AI Assist features. A local
vision-capable model is meaningfully heavier than the text models used
elsewhere and a poor fit for typical Codespace resources, while Gemini
handles images as a normal part of its existing free tier. Consequence: if
no Gemini key is configured, photo import is simply unavailable — every
other feature, including URL import, is unaffected.

## 2026-08-31 — Free-first

No paid infrastructure during prototype development (Milestones 0–9).
Hosted/paid services are deferred to Milestone 10 and require a new
decision entry before adoption.
